Maybe it's 6^n power minus some constant which may or may not be influenced by the previous value. No definitely not.
k^2 choose 2 minus some constant.
nCr=n!(nâˆ’r)!r! C r n = n ! / ( n - r ) ! r ! 
that constant is 8 * 2 * 2^(n-3) because going in both directions when n > 3. these numbers get wild pretty quickly,
wondering if there's some cancel or if the k^2 choose 2 can be just multiplied by some constant like this is.
the second constant is wrong, it's going from 8 -> 24 -> 48 -> 80 so 4 * 2^(n-2)?
